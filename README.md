Project Name: Knight Go Game Project 18
Knight Go is an innovative mobile augmented reality (AR) game inspired by the mechanics of Pokémon Go, tailored specifically for the University of Central Florida (UCF) campus. The game combines the thrill of AR with the excitement of strategic gameplay, where players explore the campus to discover and capture various knight mascots, each designed after the school's Knightro mascot but with unique elemental powers like water, fire, earth, and iron.

Players collect these knights as they traverse through the campus, with each knight type offering different strengths and weaknesses that play a crucial role in the game’s combat system. This system is dice-based but operates behind the scenes to maintain a streamlined and immersive experience. Players can battle their collected knights against others in a strategy-driven format where elemental advantages can turn the tide of combat.
